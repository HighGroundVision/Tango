            <h2 class="text-center">General Rules</h2>

            <h3>Administration</h3>
            <p>
              Everybody who is authorized by HGV to administrate the 'HGV AD
              Open 2020 League' based on its rules and regulations will be
              called an "admin" in the following, the collection of all admins
              will be called the "administration". A Discord bot handles most of
              the administration duties of the leagues events.
            </p>

            <h3>Participants and Commitment</h3>
            <p>
              Every individual with a valid steam account, unless officially
              banned, is allowed to participate in the HGV League and will be
              called "participant" in the following. A group of participants
              fulfilling the minimum required number of team members will be
              called a "team" in the following.
            </p>
            <p>
              By signing up to the HGV League, participants acknowledge without
              limitation to comply with the rules and regulations and with the
              statements and decisions made by the administration.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every participant acknowledges the right for the administration to
              modify the rules and regulations for adjustments at any time
              without notice and, if necessary, overrule those to ensure fair
              play throughout each season.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every participant must show respect towards admins and other
              participants. Insults and unfair or disrespectful behavior towards
              anyone are not tolerated and will be punished.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every participant must always have the newest version of Steam and
              Dota 2 installed and must check for updates with enough time to
              download and install them before each match. Unless a new version
              comes out right before the match, patching is not a valid reason
              to delay it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every team and participant must try to win every game at any point
              of the HGV League. Purposefully losing for any reason is strictly
              forbidden. Purposefully abandoning a match will be reviewed and
              will be punished.
            </p>

            <h3>Communication</h3>
            <p>
              All communication must be held in English at all times in the HGV
              League.
            </p>
            <p>
              All communication between opposing teams should be conducted
              through the official Discord. Any other form of communication may
              not be accepted as valid by the administration in case of
              conflict. This specifically includes chat via the Steam client.
              (As there is no record of history)
            </p>
            <p>
              Vulgar, racist, sexist or otherwise offensive team or players
              names are forbidden. Same goes for team banners. Names with
              deliberately changed size and format are also not allowed.
            </p>
            <p>
              The administration can be contacted via a ticket in
              <a href="https://discord.gg/sSFjabV">Discord</a>. This helps
              admins to coordinate as a team and work faster on issues than with
              the help of other platforms. Any other form of communication may
              be ignored.
            </p>

            <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
            <p>
              All direct communication using the ticketing system is private and
              confidential to the parties involved. This includes reports,
              protests or any form of interactions with admins. The publication
              of any of the above is forbidden, unless the organizers give
              explicit permission in a written statement.
            </p>

            <a name="activity"></a>
            <h2 class="text-center">Activity</h2>
            <p>
              By signing up for the HGV League, teams agree to actively
              participate. To avoid causing inconvenience for other teams, every
              team must show up to their match dates.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any team which is unable or no longer wishes to actively take part
              in the league after signing up should communicate this to our
              league administration.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any team which does not show up to (2) matches within a phase will
              be disqualified from the current event.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any team that got disqualified from the current event loses its
              current slot. Another team maybe asked to take their place.
            </p>

            <a name="league"></a>
            <h2 class="text-center">League Structure</h2>
            <p>
              The league will be played out over a number of seasons. 
            </p>
            <p>
              A season will start with (6) weeks of groups.
              The groups will be played out in a swiss style.
              Each group match up will play (2) games.
              The winner will get (2) points, tie will get (1) points, and a bye will grant (0.5) points.
            </p>
            <p>
              The results of the groups stage will be seed the
              playoffs. The playoffs will be Double Elimination.
              Each series will be a Bo3 but the finals is a Bo5.
            </p>

            <a name="schedule"></a>
            <h2 class="text-center">League Schedule</h2>

            <p>
              Games are scheduled every week on Tuesday night. Please do not
              register if Tuesday nights are going to be a problem for you or
              your team. Reschedules are allowed in the League, but they are a
              courtesy and not mandatory. Teams can expect to play every
              Thursday night, no communication required.
            </p>
            <p>
              To propose a reschedule, contact the other team via discord. We
              will have Captains listed in the captain’s channel to aid you in
              contacting them. Once a reschedule is agreed upon, please update
              the match time on the website so that other people know. If both
              captains cannot agree on a new time to reschedule, the DEFAULT
              time IS the scheduled time. If captains agree to a rescheduled
              time they cannot later decide to change it back to the default
              time and catch a team/captain unaware.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each week’s schedule is generated after all matches from the
              pervious week have finished. Games have to be played before Sunday
              night 9:00 PM EST or it becomes a forfeit in favor of the team
              that could play Tuesday. Make sure you agree upon a reschedule
              before Tuesday... Don’t try to work it out after the fact! Please
              check your match pages daily for comments or changes!
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-center">Teams and Players</h2>
            <h3>Eligible Teams</h3>
            <p>
              In order to sign up for Tournaments a team must have at least five
              (5) members and a single captain. Each member should have a valid
              steam ID. Each team should registered with both the website and
              Dota2.
            </p>

            <h3>Eligible Players</h3>
            <p>
              The account must have a minimum of 20 AD games. A player may only
              take part in a match as a team member if they haven't joined the
              team within (24) hours of the official match time. Otherwise, they
              will count as a stand-in and the team must comply with the
              stand-in rules.
            </p>

            <h3>Stand-ins</h3>
            <p>
              Stand-ins are participants playing for a team during a game who
              are not team members.
            </p>
            <p>
              The maximum number of stand-ins a team may use is limited to two
              (2) players per game.
            </p>
            <p>
              A stand-in may not be a member of a another team competing in the
              same season.
            </p>
            <p>
              A stand-in must meet all the criteria listed in Eligible Players
              Rules in addition to the following ones.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you need to use a stand-in for a game, the captain must make a
              ticket with the following information: steam Id/discord of the
              player being replaced and the stand-in, and who you are playing
              against. We will include the opposing captain in the ticket and
              ensure that all protocols are followed. If you use a stand-in
              without admin approval, you risk possible draft penalties in
              future series or even forfeiting the game/series or, depending on
              the severity of the offense.
            </p>
            <p>
              You must notify the other captain that you will be using a stand
              in as soon as possible. We want teams to have the chance to
              prepare, and having a last minute stand-in appear is not ideal for
              anyone. We also want to encourage teams to play with their
              registered rosters and avoid any delays. Penalties in terms of
              points for late announced stand-in at (1) hour, and (30) minutes
              before the scheduled game time will be (-1) and (-2) respectively.
            </p>

            <h3>Team Roster Restrictions</h3>
            <p>
              Only the person that is marked as captain can transfer their
              leadership to another person. The leadership can also be
              forcefully changed if more than 50% of the team members decide on
              a new captain. This must be requested via communication with and
              approved by an administrator via a ticket.
            </p>

            <p>
              Each team may add up to one (1) new player to their team during an
              season to replace a departing member.
            </p>
            <p>
              A player may only change their team once per season. Therefore, a
              player cannot return to their original team within a season after
              they have joined a new team.
            </p>
            <h3>Captain Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>
              Make sure your team can make it to the matches, or rescheduling/finding a stand-in in a timely fashion. 
              Ensuring that the match settings are correct. 
              Making sure your players are displaying good sportsmanship.
              Making sure your players are compliant with the rules.
            </p>

            <a name="hosting"></a>
            <h2 class="text-center">Hosting and Punctuality</h2>

            <h3>Lobby Hosting</h3>
            <p>
              The team that is hosting the series at listed on the match page
              (Home Team), and that team is expected to create the lobby with
              the team names as the lobby title.
            </p>
            <p>
              Main event lobbies maybe hosted be league admins.
            </p>

            <h3>Punctuality</h3>
            <p>
              If one team is not ready to start the first game 15 minutes after
              the official match time, this team loses the first game by
              default. The team has another 15 minutes to be ready for game 2.
            </p>
            <p>
              The official match time for game 2 is five (5) minutes after the
              end of game 1. Teams then have another 15 minutes to be ready for
              the game.
            </p>

            <h3>Spectators</h3>
            <p>
              Casters from the official casters channel in discord are allowed
              to cast games other Spectators should watch through dotatv.
              Captains have the right to refuse casters they are not comfortable
              with. If a captain refuses a caster they must cast the match from
              the watch tab.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any streams of matches must be 5 minutes behind the actual game
              (live game with 5 minute stream delay, or 5 min dotatv delay with
              no stream delay). Please be professional and respectful with the
              casting and avoid flaming/bullying. A balanced cast that isn’t one
              sided to one team is the most enjoyable. If a team complains about
              the cast, punishments may be handed out, including but not limited
              to loss of the caster role in discord.
            </p>

            <h3>Server Location</h3>
            <p>The default server location depends on the region:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>NA/SA => US East</li>
              <li>EU/CIS => EU East</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              A different server may be used if both teams agree on it or an
              admin decides to.
            </p>

            <h3>Lineup Check</h3>
            <p>
              Both teams are responsible for checking their opponent's roster
              before the start of the game. If a roster is found not valid
              according to the rules, the team can refuse to start the game.
            </p>
            <p>
              As soon as the first creep wave spawns, the game is considered
              ongoing and protests about the roster are no longer accepted.
            </p>
            <p>
              Delays caused by invalid rosters are treated like any other delay
              and are covered in the Punctuality rules. However, every team has
              at least five (5) minutes to fix an invalid roster regardless of
              how much time is remaining.

            <h3>Game Ending</h3>

              of a team leaves on purpose, or when the administration decides
              that it has ended. A game is not forfeited when a player types
              "gg" or "ff".
