		<h2>Path Notes: 7.07</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>New Drafting UI</li>
			<li>Added support for chat during draft.</li>
			<li>Added support for swapping ability slots.</li>
			<li>Added tooltips for hero talents and base stats as well as indicators for hero primary attributes.</li>
			<li>Scoreboard will now show drafted abilities at end of game and when viewing replays.</li>
			<li><b class="important-new">17 New</b> heroes. Including Dark Willow and Pangolier.</li>
			<li><b class="important-existing">6 Existing</b> heroes have been fixed.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>What dose this mean for AD?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>It is nice to see AD getting some love.</li>	
			<li>This change will fix a number of existing game breaking bugs.</li>
			<li>As well as introduce some new heros and some old favourites.</li>
			<li>Although these heroes will have limited abilities in the pool.</li>
			<li>Hopefuly this will translate into more people playing Ability Draft!</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>What dose this mean for HGV?</h2>
		<p>A number of these changes has maybe the existing <a href="http://www.abilitydrafter.com">Ability Drafter</a> website obsolete.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Tooltips for base stats</li>
			<li>Tooltips for primary attribute</li>
			<li>Tooltips for talents</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Since the primary focus of the website was to provide these details to drafters and that will no longer be needed after the update we are refocusing the website towards drafting.</p>
		<p>While we had this feature in the existing website it never worked correctly because most of the data was infered from the ability level up data which was often incomplete and did not include the drafting order.</p>
		<p>With the addation of the drafted abilities in the Scoreboard we now have the data we need to do a better job!<p>
		<p>Infact the <a href="https://github.com/HighGroundVision/Crystalys">Crystalys</a> & <a href="https://github.com/HighGroundVision/Orchid">Orchid</a> Projects where built to get the Scoreboard details. Althought they need to be updated to use the new protobuff files.
		<h2>Next Steps</h2>
		<p>We are currently building a new pipline to supply the Scoreboard details as an API.</p>
		<p>You can get more update details on our twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/DotaHGV">@DotaHGV</a></p>
